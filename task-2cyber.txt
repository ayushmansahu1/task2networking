What is a network?A computer network is a group of interconnecteddevices that are designed to communicate andshareinformation with each other. Uses of computer networks1. Resource Sharing:
Resource sharing in computer networks referstothe ability to share hardware, software, anddataamong connected devices. Here's a detailedexplanation:
Hardware Sharing: Computer networks allowmultiple users to share hardware devices suchasprinters, scanners, and storage devices. For
example, in an office environment, a singleprintercan be connected to the network, and all userswithin the network can print documents tothat
printer, eliminating the need for individual printersfor each user. Software Sharing: Networks enable the sharingofsoftware applications and licenses. Insteadof
installing software on every individual computer,
applications can be installed on a central serverandaccessed by users over the network. This not onlysaves storage space but also simplifies softwareupdates and maintenance.
Data Sharing: Networks facilitate the sharingandaccess of data stored on servers or shareddrives. Multiple users can access and collaborate ondocuments, spreadsheets, and other files storedcentrally. This promotes collaboration, versioncontrol, and efficient workflowmanagement. 2. Communication:
Communication is a primary function of computernetworks, enabling the exchange of informationbetween users and devices. Here's a breakdown:
Email: Networks support email communication,
allowing users to send and receive messages
electronically. Email systems typically operateoverthe Internet or within an organization's intranet,
providing efficient communication channels forboth personal and professional purposes. Instant Messaging (IM): IMservices allowrealtime text-based communication betweenusersovera network. IM platforms often include additional
features such as file sharing, group chats, andvideocalls, facilitating quick and informal
communication among individuals or teams. Video Conferencing: Networks enable videoconferencing solutions, allowing users toconduct
face-to-face meetings remotely. Video
conferencing platforms support multi-party
conferences, screen sharing, and collaborationtools,enabling virtual meetings with participants fromdifferent locations. Voice over IP (VoIP): VoIP technologyenablesvoice communication over computer networks,
transmitting voice signals digitally insteadof
traditional phone lines. VoIP services offer cost-effective and feature-rich alternatives totraditionaltelephone systems, supporting voice calls, videocalls, and conferencing over IP networks. 3. Information Access:
Computer networks provide access to vast amountsof information stored on servers, databases, andtheinternet. Here's how information access works:
Local Information Access: Networks allowuserstoaccess resources and information storedlocallyonservers, shared drives, or databases withinthesamenetwork. This includes documents, databases, andother files hosted on internal servers accessibletoauthorized users. Internet Access: Networks connect users totheinternet, enabling access to a wealth of onlineresources such as websites, web applications, andcloud services. Internet access facilitates research,
communication, entertainment, and e-commerce,
empowering users to explore and interact withonline content from any location. Remote Information Access: Networks support
remote access to internal resources and services,
allowing users to connect securely fromoutsidetheorganization's premises. Technologies suchasVirtual Private Networks (VPNs) and RemoteDesktop Protocol (RDP) enable users toaccesstheir organization's network and resources overtheinternet, maintaining security and privacy. 4. Centralized Management:
Centralized management in computer networksrefers to the centralized control and administrationof network resources, users, and securitypolicies. Here's how it works:
Network Administration: Network administratorsmanage and monitor network resources, includingservers, switches, routers, and other networkdevices, from a central location. Centralizedmanagement simplifies configuration, monitoring,
and troubleshooting tasks, enhancing networkefficiency and reliability. User Management: Centralized user management
systems, such as directory services like ActiveDirectory (in Windows environments) or LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), enable
administrators to manage user accounts,
permissions, and access rights centrally. Thisensures consistency and security across thenetwork. Security Management: Centralized securitymanagement involves implementing andenforcingsecurity policies, such as firewalls, antivirus
software, and intrusion detection systems, fromacentral console. This allows administrators tomonitor network traffic, detect security threats, andrespond to incidents promptly, safeguardingthenetwork and its resources. 5. Remote Access:
Remote access enables users to connect toanetwork and access resources froma remotelocation. Here's how remote access is facilitated:
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): VPNs establishsecure encrypted connections over the internet,
allowing users to access the organization's networkas if they were physically present in the office. VPNs ensure data privacy and security byencrypting network traffic and authenticatingusersbefore granting access to internal resources. Remote Desktop Access: Remote DesktopProtocol(RDP) and similar technologies enable users toremotely control a computer or server fromanother
device. This allows users to access their desktopenvironment, applications, and files on a remotecomputer as if they were sitting in front of it,
facilitating remote IT support, telecommuting, andsystem administration tasks. Mobile Access: With the proliferation of mobiledevices such as smartphones and tablets, remoteaccess solutions extend to mobile platforms. Mobile VPN clients and remote desktopapplications enable users to access networkresources and applications securely fromtheir
mobile devices, supporting flexible workarrangements and on-the-go productivity.

OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model isa conceptual framework that standardizes thefunctions of a communication systemintosevendistinct layers. Each layer in the OSI model servesa specific purpose and provides a standardizedinterface for communication between different
devices and systems. The model was developedbythe International Organization for Standardization(ISO) to facilitate interoperability and compatibilitybetween various network technologies andprotocols. Let's explore each layer of the OSI
model in detail:
1. Physical Layer (Layer 1):
The Physical Layer is the lowest layer of theOSImodel and deals with the physical transmissionofdata over the network medium. Functions include transmitting rawdata bits overaphysical medium (such as copper wires, fiber opticcables, or wireless radio frequencies) anddefiningcharacteristics such as voltage levels, signal timing,and physical connectors. Examples of Physical Layer devices andcomponents include network interface cards (NICs),cables, hubs, repeaters, and modems. This layer focuses on the mechanical, electrical,
and procedural aspects of transmitting dataand
does not concern itself with the logical or
contextual meaning of the data. 2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
The Data Link Layer is responsible for establishing,maintaining, and terminating logical links betweendevices on the same network segment. Functions include framing, error detectionandcorrection, flow control, and media access control(MAC). Divided into two sublayers: Logical LinkControl
(LLC), which handles framing and error checking,
and Media Access Control (MAC), whichdealswith addressing and media arbitration. Examples of Data Link Layer devices andprotocols include Ethernet switches, wirelessaccess points, Ethernet frames, and IEEE802.3and802.11 standards. 3. Network Layer (Layer 3):
The Network Layer is concerned with routingandforwarding data packets between different
networks, enabling end-to-end communicationacross multiple network segments. Functions include addressing, routing, andpacket
switching, as well as congestion control andlogicalnetwork addressing. IP (Internet Protocol) is the primary protocol usedat this layer, responsible for logical addressingand
routing packets between source and destinationnetworks. Routers are key devices at the NetworkLayer,
making forwarding decisions based on destinationIP addresses. 4. Transport Layer (Layer 4):
The Transport Layer ensures reliable end-to-endcommunication between devices by providingerrorrecovery, flow control, and segmentationandreassembly of data. Functions include segmenting data fromupper
layers into smaller packets, ensuring delivery, andreassembling packets at the receiving end. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) andUserDatagram Protocol (UDP) are the two mainprotocols at this layer, offering connection-orientedand connectionless communication, respectively. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checkeddelivery of data, while UDP offers a simpler,
connectionless approach suitable for real-timeapplications. 5. Session Layer (Layer 5):
The Session Layer establishes, manages, andterminates communication sessions betweenapplications on different devices. Functions include session establishment,
maintenance, and synchronization, as well ascheckpointing and recovery mechanisms.
This layer allows applications to establishconnections, exchange data, and coordinatecommunication sessions, ensuring orderlycommunication between end systems. Examples of Session Layer protocols includeNetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call), andSession Initiation Protocol (SIP). 6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
The Presentation Layer is responsible for datatranslation, encryption, compression, andformatting, ensuring that data exchangedbetweenapplications is in a format that the receivingapplication can understand. Functions include data encryption and decryption,
character code translation, data compression, anddata syntax conversion. This layer deals with the representationof data,
abstracting differences in data formats andencoding schemes between different systems. Examples of Presentation Layer standards includeJPEG (image compression), ASCII (character
encoding), and SSL/TLS (encryption protocols). 7. Application Layer (Layer 7):
The Application Layer is the topmost layer of theOSI model and provides network services directlyto end-users and applications. Functions include providing access to networkresources and services, supporting communication
between applications, and facilitating user
interaction with the network. This layer hosts application-specific protocolsandservices such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and DNS(Domain Name System). End-user applications interact with the ApplicationLayer to initiate communication, exchangedata,
and access network services and resources.
TCP/IP Protocol
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a widelyadopted networking model that serves as thefoundation for communication over the Internet. Itconsists of four layers, each with its ownset of
protocols and functions. The TCP/IPmodel islessstructured than the OSI model but serves as apractical framework for understanding andimplementing internet communication. Let's
explore each layer of the TCP/IP model indetail:
1. Application Layer:
The Application Layer is the topmost layer of theTCP/IP model and is responsible for providingnetwork services directly to end-users andapplications. Functions include enabling communicationbetween end-user applications, facilitatingaccessto network resources and services, and supportinguser interaction with the network. A variety of protocols operate at this layer tosupport different application requirements. Somecommon protocols include:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Usedfor
transmitting web pages and related data over theInternet.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferringfiles between hosts on a TCP/IP network. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Usedforsending email messages between servers. DNS (Domain Name System): Used for translatingdomain names into IP addresses. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
Used for dynamically assigning IP addressestodevices on a network. 2. Transport Layer:
The Transport Layer is responsible for end-to-endcommunication between devices and ensuresthereliable and efficient delivery of data. Functions include segmenting data fromtheApplication Layer into smaller packets, providingerror detection and correction, and managingdataflow and congestion control. Two main protocols operate at this layer:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Providesreliable, connection-oriented communicationwithfeatures such as acknowledgment, sequencing, andflow control. TCP is used for applications that
require guaranteed delivery of data, suchas webbrowsing, email, and file transfer. UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Provides
unreliable, connectionless communicationwithminimal overhead. UDP is used for applicationswhere speed and efficiency are more critical than
reliability, such as real-time streaming, VoIP(Voice over Internet Protocol), and online gaming. 3. Internet Layer:
The Internet Layer is responsible for addressing,
routing, and forwarding data packets betweendifferent networks, enabling global communicationacross the Internet. Functions include assigning IP addresses todevices,encapsulating data into IP packets, and determiningthe optimal path for packet delivery. The primary protocol at this layer is the Internet
Protocol (IP), which provides logical addressingand routing functions. IPv4 (Internet Protocol
version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version6)are the two main versions of the IP protocol. Other protocols and technologies operatingat theInternet Layer include:
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Usedfor error reporting, diagnostics, and networkmanagement. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Usedfor
mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses onlocal
networks. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
Also operates at the Internet Layer to assignIPaddresses dynamically to devices on a network.
4. Network Access Layer:
The Link Layer is responsible for the physical
transmission of data over the local networkmedium and provides hardware-specific protocolsfor data encapsulation and transmission. Functions include framing data into frames,
addressing frames with MAC addresses, andmanaging access to the physical networkmedium. Different protocols operate at this layer dependingon the network technology being used. Commonlink layer protocols include:
Ethernet: Used in wired LANs (Local AreaNetworks) to transmit data over twisted-pair or
fiber optic cables. Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11): Used in wireless LANstotransmit data over radio frequencies. PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): Used for
establishing direct connections betweentwonodesover serial links, such as dial-up or DSLconnections. ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode): Usedinsome legacy networks for transmitting datainfixed-size cells over synchronous optical or copper-based networks.
Network Devices
1. Hub:
A hub is a basic networking device that operatesatthe Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. Functions by receiving data packets fromonedevice and broadcasting themto all other devicesconnected to the hub. Lacks intelligence and does not make decisionsabout where to send data, leading to inefficient useof network bandwidth and increased collisionrates.Rarely used in modern networks due toits
limitations and the availability of more advanceddevices like switches. Sometimes used for network monitoringor
troubleshooting purposes. 2. Switch:
A switch is a networking device that operatesat theData Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. Functions by receiving data frames fromdevicesand forwarding them only to the intendedrecipientbased on MAC addresses. Provides dedicated bandwidth to each port, leadingto improved network performance, reducedcollision rates, and increased security comparedtohubs.
Supports full-duplex communication, allowingsimultaneous transmission and receptionof dataoneach port. Commonly used in LANs (Local Area Networks)to connect multiple devices and segment networktraffic efficiently. 3. Router:
A router is a networking device that operatesat theNetwork Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. Functions by examining the destinationIPaddressof incoming data packets and making forwardingdecisions to send them to the appropriate
destination network. Connects multiple networks together andenablescommunication between devices on different
networks. Performs functions such as IP address assignment,
network address translation (NAT), andfirewallingto enhance network security. Supports dynamic routing protocols suchas OSPF(Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border
Gateway Protocol) to dynamically adjust routingtables based on network conditions.
Network Protocols
The 3-way handshake is a foundational networkprotocol used in the establishment of a TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) connectionbetween two devices on a network. This processisessential for ensuring reliable and orderlycommunication between devices. The 3-wayhandshake follows a sequence of steps involvingthree messages exchanged between the client andserver to establish a TCP connection. Let's delveinto each step of the 3-way handshake protocol:
Step 1: SYN (Synchronize)
The client initiates the TCP connection bysendinga SYN packet to the server. The SYN packet contains a sequence number
chosen by the client to start the connectionestablishment process. This sequence number is randomly generatedandserves to identify the data sent in subsequent
packets. After sending the SYN packet, the client enterstheSYN_SENT state, indicating that it has initiatedtheconnection and is waiting for a response fromtheserver.
Step 2: SYN-ACK (Synchronize- Acknowledgment)
Upon receiving the SYN packet fromthe client, theserver responds with a SYN-ACKpacket. The SYN-ACK packet contains two important
pieces of information:
A SYN flag, indicating that the server is
synchronizing its sequence numbers withtheclient.An acknowledgment number, which is theclient'ssequence number incremented by one,
acknowledging receipt of the client's SYNpacket. Additionally, the server selects its own initial
sequence number, which is included in theSYN-ACK packet. After sending the SYN-ACKpacket, the serverenters the SYN_RECEIVEDstate, indicatingthat ithas received the client's connection request andiswaiting for the final acknowledgment fromtheclient. Step 3: ACK (Acknowledgment)
Finally, upon receiving the SYN-ACKpacket fromthe server, the client sends an ACKpacket toacknowledge the receipt of the server's SYN-ACKpacket. The ACK packet contains the acknowledgment
number, which is the server's sequence number
incremented by one, acknowledging receipt of theserver's SYN-ACK packet.
At this point, the TCP connection is establishedbetween the client and server. After sending the ACK packet, both the client andserver enter the ESTABLISHEDstate, indicatingthat they are ready to exchange data over theestablished connection. The 3-way handshake protocol ensures that boththe client and server agree on initial sequencenumbers, synchronize their sequence number
generation, and acknowledge each other's messagesbefore starting data transmission. This processhelps to establish a reliable and orderly connection,allowing for the exchange of data packets withguaranteed delivery and proper sequencing. Additionally, the 3-way handshake alsoservesasamechanism for error detection and recovery, asanyanomalies or failures during the handshakeprocesscan be detected and addressed before data
transmission begins. Overall, the 3-wayhandshakeis a fundamental component of TCP/IPnetworking,providing the foundation for reliable
communication between devices on a network.
